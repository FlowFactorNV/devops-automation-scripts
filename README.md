#   DevOps Automation Scripts 🚀 
A collection of reusable automation scripts—for DevOps engineers **and developers who have to do it all.**_

##  Why This Repo Exists
We get it. You're a developer, but suddenly you're also responsible for:

- **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Cloud infrastructure**
- **Security scans**
- **Monitoring & logging**

You're expected to deploy fast **without breaking production.**  
This repo is here to help.

> ⚠️ **Important:** 

These scripts aren’t a magic solution—they’re tools to get you started. They worked for us at a certain time, and we’re sharing them so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But every environment is different.

FlowFactor assumes no responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions, or unexpected chaos that might arise from using them. The scripts are provided as is, with no guarantees of completeness, accuracy, or suitability for your use case.

📌 Test before deploying. Adjust for your needs. And if you need help? You know where to find us.
