#   DevOps Automation Hub 🚀 
A collection of battle-tested, reusable automation scripts—for DevOps engineers **and developers who have to do it all.**_

##  Why This Repo Exists
We get it. You're a developer, but suddenly you're also responsible for:

- **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Cloud infrastructure**
- **Security scans**
- **Monitoring & logging**

You're expected to deploy fast **without breaking production.**  
This repo is here to help.

> ⚠️ **Important:** These scripts are generic! You **must** adjust them for your stack & infrastructure.
